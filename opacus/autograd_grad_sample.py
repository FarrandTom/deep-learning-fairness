This module provides functions to capture per-sample gradients by using hooks.

Notes
-----
The ``register_backward_hook()`` function has a known issue being tracked at
https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/598. However, it is the only known
way of implementing this as of now (your suggestions and contributions are
very welcome). The behaviour has been verified to be correct for the layers
currently supported by opacus.

    Adds hooks to model to save activations and backprop values.
    The hooks will

    1. save activations into ``param.activations`` during forward pass.
    2. compute per-sample gradients and save them in ``param.grad_sample``
    during backward pass.

    ----------
    model: nn.Module
        Model to which hooks are added.
    loss_reduction: str
        Indicates if the loss reduction (for aggregating the gradients)
        is a sum or a mean operation. Can take values ``sum`` or ``mean``.
        Default value is ``mean``.
    batch_first: bool
        Flag to indicate if the input tensor to the corresponding module
        has the first dimension represent the batch, for example of shape
        ``[batch_size, ..., ...]``. Set to True if batch appears in first
        dimension else set to False (``batch_first=False`` implies that the
        batch is always in the second dimension).
        Default value is ``True``.
